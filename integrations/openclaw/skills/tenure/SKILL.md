name: tenure
description: Persistent local memory for OpenClaw with automatic per-agent isolation. Tenure sits between your agent and your AI provider, learning your decisions, communication style, and working preferences across sessions, with no context bleed between agents. Unlike other memory plugins that require manual userId or agentId scoping, isolation is automatic and zero-config. Runs entirely on localhost. No MEMORY.md required.

# Tenure — Persistent Memory for OpenClaw

## Installing Tenure

Run steps in order. Tell the user what you are doing before each step.

### Step 1 — Check Docker is running

```bash
docker info
```

If this fails, tell the user to start Docker Desktop and try again.

### Step 2 — Check port 5757 is free

```bash
lsof -i :5757 2>/dev/null || echo "port-free"
```

Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :5757`

If the port is in use, tell the user to free it or set `TENURE_PORT` to a different value and substitute it everywhere `5757` appears below.

### Step 3 — Initialize Tenure

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.tenure"
docker run --rm -v "$HOME/.tenure:/app/.tenure" tenureai/tenure:latest init
```

Windows: replace `$HOME/.tenure` with `$env:USERPROFILE\.tenure` in all commands.

### Step 4 — Start Tenure

```bash
docker compose -f "$HOME/.tenure/docker-compose.yml" --env-file "$HOME/.tenure/.env" up -d
```

### Step 5 — Wait for Tenure to be ready

Poll up to 60 seconds:

```bash
TENURE_PORT="${TENURE_PORT:-5757}"
ATTEMPTS=0
until curl -sf "http://localhost:${TENURE_PORT}/healthz" >/dev/null 2>&1 || [ $ATTEMPTS -ge 30 ]; do
  ATTEMPTS=$((ATTEMPTS + 1)); sleep 2
done
if [ $ATTEMPTS -ge 30 ]; then echo "timeout"; else echo "ready"; fi
```

If timeout: `docker compose -f "$HOME/.tenure/docker-compose.yml" logs tenure`

### Step 6 — Read the token

```bash
cat "$HOME/.tenure/token"
```

Windows: `Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.tenure\token"`

If the file does not exist, Tenure hasn't finished first-run setup — wait a few seconds and retry, or check logs.

### Step 7 — Persist the token

```bash
echo "TENURE_TOKEN=$(cat "$HOME/.tenure/token")" >> "$HOME/.openclaw/.env"
```

Windows:

```powershell
Add-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.openclaw\.env" "TENURE_TOKEN=$(Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.tenure\token")"
```

### Step 8 — Register the Tenure provider in OpenClaw

```bash
TENURE_TOKEN=$(cat "$HOME/.tenure/token")
openclaw config patch --stdin << EOF
{
  models: {
    mode: "merge",
    providers: {
      tenure: {
        baseUrl: "http://localhost:5757/v1",
        apiKey: "$TENURE_TOKEN",
        api: "openai-completions",
        request: { allowPrivateNetwork: true }
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

Windows: read token with `$token = Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.tenure\token"` and substitute `$token` in the patch.

Then validate — do not proceed if this fails:

```bash
openclaw config validate
```

### Step 9 — Install the plugin and apply integration config

```bash
openclaw plugins install @tenureai/openclaw-plugin
```

```bash
openclaw config patch --stdin << EOF
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      skipBootstrap: true,
      memorySearch: { enabled: false },
      compaction: { memoryFlush: { enabled: false } }
    }
  },
  plugins: {
    slots: { memory: "none" },
    entries: { "active-memory": { enabled: false } }
  }
}
EOF
```

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Step 10 — Confirm and hand off

Tell the user:

> "Tenure is installed and running. Your existing provider is still active — Tenure sits in front of it and adds memory automatically.
>
> - **Token:** `<value from step 6>`
> - **Base URL:** `http://localhost:5757/v1`
>
> Run **!tenure onboarding** when you're ready to set up your memory — takes about 2 minutes.
>
> Any memory plugins have been disabled since Tenure replaces them. Re-enable with `openclaw config set plugins.slots.memory memory-core` if you remove Tenure later."

On mobile channels, note the localhost URL must be opened on the machine running the gateway.

## !tenure onboarding

Run this flow when the user invokes `!tenure onboarding`. Use `$TENURE_TOKEN` for all API calls.

### Stage 1 — Provider setup

Ask: "Which provider do you want Tenure to use — Anthropic or OpenAI?" Then ask for their API key.

```bash
curl -sf -X PUT http://localhost:5757/admin/providers/PROVIDER_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TENURE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api_key":"USER_KEY"}'
```

`"ok":true` → proceed. `502` → key rejected, ask user to check and retry.

### Stage 2 — Model selection

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:5757/v1/onboarding/probe-models/PROVIDER_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TENURE_TOKEN"
```

Present top 2-3 models where `supported: true`. Ask user to pick one, then validate:

```bash
curl -sf -X POST http://localhost:5757/v1/onboarding/validate-model \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TENURE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"provider_id":"PROVIDER_ID","model_id":"CHOSEN_MODEL"}'
```

`"ok":true` → set as primary:

```bash
openclaw config patch --stdin << EOF
{ models: { mode: "merge", providers: { tenure: { models: [{ id: "CHOSEN_MODEL", name: "CHOSEN_MODEL" }] } } } }
EOF
openclaw config set agents.defaults.models '{"tenure/CHOSEN_MODEL":{}}' --strict-json --merge
openclaw models set "tenure/CHOSEN_MODEL"
```

`502` → model ping failed, ask user to pick another.

### Stage 3 — Onboarding questions

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:5757/v1/onboarding/questions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TENURE_TOKEN"
```

Group by `category`. Ask each category as a natural conversation, not a form. Accumulate answers by `id`. Skipped categories are fine.

### Stage 4 — Commit

```bash
curl -sf -X POST http://localhost:5757/v1/onboarding/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TENURE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"answers": ANSWERS_ARRAY}'
```

If response contains `draft_id`:

```bash
curl -sf -X POST http://localhost:5757/v1/onboarding/commit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TENURE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"draft_id":"DRAFT_ID"}'
```

If `belief_count` is 0 or `parse_failed` is true, skip commit and tell the user they can re-run `!tenure onboarding` at any time.

### Stage 5 — Confirm

> "You're set. N beliefs saved to your world model. Tenure will carry your context into every session automatically.
>
> View and edit your beliefs at http://localhost:5757/beliefs"

## Agent notes

- `allowPrivateNetwork: true` is required — without it OpenClaw cannot reach localhost:5757.
- The token is a plain file at `~/.tenure/token`. The plugin reads it automatically. `$TENURE_TOKEN` is available in exec calls after Step 7.
- No models array is needed in the provider block at install time — populated during onboarding Stage 2.
- `!extract`, `!inject`, and `!scope` are intercepted by Tenure at the proxy level. Do not handle them. If they stop working, Tenure is unreachable — check health and logs.
- If `openclaw onboard` overwrites `agents.defaults.model.primary`, restore with `openclaw models set "tenure/CHOSEN_MODEL"`.
- To pause memory without removing Tenure: `!extract global off` and `!inject global off`.
- To update Tenure: `docker compose -f "$HOME/.tenure/docker-compose.yml" pull && docker compose -f "$HOME/.tenure/docker-compose.yml" up -d`
