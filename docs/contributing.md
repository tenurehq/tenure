# Contributing to Tenure

The best contributions right now are:

- Retrieval gaps documented as failing eval cases
- Provider compatibility fixes
- Client setup guides for clients not yet in [docs/clients.md](docs/clients.md)
- Bug reports with reproduction steps

## Design Principles

- **Conservative writes, liberal reads.** When extraction signals disagree, don't write. When assembling context, include generously.
- **No temporal decay.** Beliefs don't weaken with age. They remain active until explicitly superseded.
- **Compaction is a view, not a write.** Raw history is always preserved; the compacted window is computed on read.
- **Beliefs are never deleted.** Superseded beliefs are marked and retained. The full mutation arc is always auditable.
- **Extraction never blocks responses.** The worker runs asynchronously; your session is never held waiting for belief writes.
- **No hardcoded model lists.** `/v1/models` queries upstream providers directly.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tenurehq/tenure
cd tenure
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # add your provider keys
npm run dev
```

Tests require Docker for the Atlas Local container:

```bash
npm test                  # unit + integration
npm run test:eval         # retrieval eval suite (~90s first run)
```

## How to Contribute a Retrieval Fix

The retrieval eval suite in `src/retrieval/retrieval.cases.json` is the most
direct way to contribute. If you find a case where Tenure surfaces the wrong
belief or misses one you'd expect:

1. Add a failing case to `retrieval.cases.json` with `shouldOnlyInclude`,
   `mustExclude`, or `orderedBefore` assertions and a `notes` field explaining
   what the correct behavior should be
2. Open a PR with just the failing case. A fix is welcome but not required
3. If you have a fix, include it alongside the case so the suite passes

This is the lowest-friction contribution path. A well-described failing case
is as valuable as a fix because it documents a known blind spot precisely.
See [docs/retrieval-eval.md](docs/retrieval-eval.md) for how the suite works.

## Submitting a PR

- Keep PRs focused - one fix or one feature per PR
- If you're changing extraction behavior, include a test case
- If you're changing retrieval behavior, include an eval case
- The design principles above are the bar for architectural changes; if a change conflicts with one of them, explain why in the PR description
